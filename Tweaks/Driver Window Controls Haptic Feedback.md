## Situation
Unlinke previous VW models, there are only two driver side window switches that by default control the front driver and passenger windows. 
- To control the rear windows the REAR "soft" button (not a physical button, does not have any haptic feedback)  needs to be touched for more than 1 second, then the button lights up, and the rear windows can be controlled by the same controls that previously controlled the front windows. The button stays lit for approx. 10 seconds, then turns off, reverting the controls to the front windows. 
- If the "REAR" soft button is touched and held for 2+ seconds, it starts to blink and all four windows can be controlled at the same time :heart:. 

## Challenges
1. The REAR soft button can't be located easilly without looking. There is no "dot or mark" that can be felt with a finger to locate it more easilly
2. There is no haptic feedback in case the button is activated indicating the mode selected REAR/ALL modes
     - There is a small "chime" in the speakers once the mode is changed, but it's not too obvious and can be easily missed
     - Furthermore to activate the button with a finger, the finger must cover the button and the completely blocks the light indicator. As such itâ€™s not possible to see the mode it entered, unless the finger is lifted and eyes taken off the road ...and more distraction from driving.

## Solution to challenge #1 - "locating the button"
...is to e.g. add two self-adhesive pads to help easily locate the touch sensitive area without looking at the location.
One of the approaches below:

This itself is a big help for me :man_dancing: :woman_dancing:

## Solution to challenge #2 - "adding haptic feedback" 

To add haptic feedback, or improve the experience even further, there are many options, couple outlined below:

Option | Details | Pros/Cons | OEM
---|---|---|---
#1 - Clone "REAR" button LED signal with a vibration motor | Once the REAR soft button lights up a vibration motor in the unit will vibrate giving a haptic confirmaton | Simple circuit, but requires tapping into the circuit board of the unit | No
#2 - Digitally process the "REAR" button LED signal and digitally manage the haptic experience | A micro-controller will receive the REAR button LED signal and control the vibration motor to create better haptic experience | As above requires tapping into the unit, has to wait approx 1 sec to "decode" the mode from the REAR button LED (blinking vs. solid on) | No
#3 - Connect to the control unit's LIN bus, process its signals and digitally control haptic experience | Use the same connector as the control unit for "snap-on" installation. The control unit has 3 wires - VCC, Gnd and LIN. The LIN bus sends the "chime" signal to the speakers, that can be used to trigger a good haptic experience | Just plug and play, but requires to decode the LIN bus, the LIN bus data may not distinguish between the REAR and ALL window modes | No
#4 - VW aka Volkswagen to come up with updated unit that would provide better experience | Go crazy VW, but please make it backwards compatible :smiley: | "Just plug and play from the OEM" | Yes

### Option #1 - Clone REAR button LED signal with a vibration motor
This was the immediate idea that felt the simplest to execute. However it requires to permanently modify the part number known as 10A 959 862 S

#### Step 1 - get the signals
Open the OEM part and get the details...

#### Step 2 - design the circuit
A quick design with Opto-coupler to physically separate the input (yellow and green wires) and the 12V/14.4V power line (red and black wire) to protect the components and the LIN bus. The signal enters the opto-coupler ("solid state relay") [LCA110]([url](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/ixys-integrated-circuits-division/LCA110/203107)) via resistor R1 (100 Ohms). The two MOSFETs (I know I know the schematics does not show MOSFET, but a regular BJT transistor) on the output turn on the vibration motor. The resistor R2 limits the total current and it's size depends on the type of vibration motor. D1 and D2 1N4148 protect the components (D1 negative spikes from entering into the circuit, D2 from induction spikes when the motor turns off). Not on the picture - added C1 (0.1 uF) to the power rail.

#### Step 3 - test the circuit
Time to test if it works. This design used a cheap vibration motor, R2 was 330 Ohms.

</div>


#### Step 4 - design and test
Time for more rugged design, used the same vibration motor that VW uses in the steering wheel touch buttons and added variable resistors to precisely adjust the haptic experience. Both resistors ended up around 100 Ohms (the static + variable).

...then 3D printed a "vibration motor holder" from flexible filament (the red brick on the bottom). So, it is easier to attach and to provide cushioning around the vibration motor. It mimics the way it sits in the steering wheel button assembly. Protected all with beloved Tesa tape for a "professional" look :wink:

With ID software version 3.1 the 12V rail is more stable, so an intended Zener diode is not necessary. Was hoping that the id.7 / 20214 ID.4/5 will introduce a 4 switch version and I'd just swap this VW experiment for a real thing. Since that did not happen, I did wrap the handle in VVIVID XPO Black Leather Suede for luxyry look. And it really looks great... Ok so I feel this is the end of this mod... :) Off to the next one...
