Why? To make us feel better about what we drive, some of us would like to make usability changes (retrofit 360 camera system, better audio,...), improve convinience (foldable mirrors, open/closde all windows with key,...), protect the car (paint protection film, door sills,...) or change the appearance and comfort (different wheels, "black" package,...). It's up to everyone's taste. Below are some ideas...

### Core principles

1.	Use high quality OEM parts, if OEM not availbale, make it look like it "belongs there"
2.	Do not touch or interfere with any high-voltage components

Below are 3 categories of changes by the level of difficulty we discuss on this page - 

| Type | Description | Simplicity | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---  | 
| [Updates](#Updates) | OEM or vendor components manufactured for the ID. car family | L100 (Simplest) | Simple to install by following installation manaual |
| [Tweaks](#Tweaks) | Modification of existing OEM compopnents | L200-300 (Harder) | Usually no or very little "coding" or "adaptation" necessary|
| [Retrofits](#Retrofits) | Installing OEM components that were not in the vehicle for the current model year or not availbale in country of purchase | L400+ (Very hard) | Custom harness, SMD soldering and extensive "coding" / "adaptation" necessary|

### Retrofits
Retrofit is a change or addition of OEM componenets that were not available when the car was purchased. Typically, options not available in the US market or in the previous model years.

| Ventilated front seats | Front seat ventilation | Feasible - requires 4 fans, wiring and soldering in the CECM control unit | Known, needs validation | There is a plan b (availbale conveniece CAN decoder) to avoing soldering in the CECM. Needs permananet seat cushion modification. | Validated in 3.2. | https://www.vwidtalk.com/posts/292287/ |
| Heated rear seats | Add seat heaters froi the rear seats (4 heating elements) and controller to the middle console | TBD - depands on the AC module (J979) version | Doable is supported in HW | N/A | | https://www.vwidtalk.com/posts/279775/ |
| GTI/GLI/R Steering Wheel Controls | Steering wheel buttons with "R" and "Heated Steering Wheel" buttons | Feasible | Coding & ACC Adaptation needed | N/A | N/A | https://www.vwidtalk.com/posts/112011/ |

   _OEM HW (original equipment manufacturer hardware) feasibility - determines if the original hardware (parts, control units, connectors) can be used. Coding Feasibility - determines if the existing control unit supports that project._

### Tweaks
We define "tweak" is a change or addition where no OEM componenets exist. 

| Project | Description | Limitations
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- 
| [Driver Window Controls Haptic Feedback](</Tweaks/Driver%20Window%20Controls%20Haptic%20Feedback.md>) | Haptic feedback for the "famous" driver door window switches | All ID cars
| [Ventilated phone storage (German made cars)](</Tweaks/Ventilated%20Phone%20Storage.md>) | New fan to cool phone space and wireless charging plate | German-made ID.4 and ID.5 cars, all SW versions

### Updates
Updates use OEM or vendor components manufactured for the ID.4.
