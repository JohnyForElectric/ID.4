## This repo discusses various appearance and convenience "tweaks" and "retrofits" for ID.4/ID.5 car family. 

### Core principles

1.	Use OEM components (with updated coding) to make "[retrofits](#Current-list-of-Retrofits)" and only if that is not possible start making "[tweaks](#Current-list-of-Tweaks)"
2.	Do not touch or interfere with any high-voltage components

### Updates
Updates use components manufactured for this purpose.

### Tweaks
Tweak is a change or update where no OEM componenets exist. 

| Project | Description | Limitations
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- 
| [Driver Window Controls Haptic Feedback](</Tweaks/Driver%20Window%20Controls%20Haptic%20Feedback.md>) | Haptic feedback for  | All ID cars
| [Ventilated phone storage (German made cars)](</Tweaks/Ventilated%20Phone%20Storage.md>) | New fan to cool phone space and wireless charging plate | German-made ID.4 and ID.5 cars, all SW versions

### Retrofits
Retrofit is a change or addition of OEM componenets that were not available when the car was purchased. Typically options not available in the US market or previous model years. 

| Project | Description | OEM HW Feasibility | Coding Feasibility | Doable? | Works in ID.Software version and MY?
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :---  | :--- | :---
| [Euro Style Tail Lights "ID.Light"](</Retrofits/Euro%20Style%20Tail%20Lights.md>) | Rear Euro Style top trim tail lights with animations | Feasible / Done | Feasible / Done | Yes (with workaround) | 2.1, 3.1
| [360 Area View Camera](</Retrofits/360%20Area%20View%20Camera.md>) | Install 360 camera system with 4 cameras | Feasible | Coding unknown | Yes (with caveats) | N/A
| [GTX Style Diamond Pattern Accent Lights](</Retrofits/GTX%20Style%20Diamond%20Pattern%20Daylight%20Running%20Lights.md>) | Front bumper accent lights | Feasible | Coding unknown | Yes (with caveats) | N/A
| Q4 e-tron AC Control Head | A/C control panel from Q4/A3 | Feasible | Coding needed | N/A | N/A
| Ventilated front seats | Front seat ventilation | Needs Validation | Needs Validation | N/A | N/A
| GTI/GLI/R Steering Wheel Controls | Steering wheel buttons with "R" and "Heated Steering Wheel" buttons | Feasible | Coding & ACC Adaptation needed | N/A | N/A

   _OEM HW (original equipment manufacturer hardware) feasibility - determines if the original hardware (parts, control units, connectors) can be used. Coding Feasibility - determines if the existing control unit supports that project._
