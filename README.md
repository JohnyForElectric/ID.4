## This repo discusses various appearance and convenience "tweaks" and updates for ID.4/ID.5 car family. 

### Core principles

1.	Use OEM components (with updated coding) and only if that is not possible start writing code...
2.	Do not touch or interfere with any high-voltage components

### Current list of updates



| Project | OEM HW Feasibility | Coding Feasibility |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| [Driver Window Controls Haptic Feedback](<https://github.com/JohnyForElectric/ID.4/blob/main/Driver%20Window%20Controls%20Haptic%20Feedback>) | Non OEM Feasible, Option 1/3 | N/A |
| GTX Style Diamond Pattern Daylight Running Lights | Feasible | Needs Verification |
| Euro Style Tail Lights | Feasible | Needs Verification |
| Q4 e-tron AC Control Head | Feasible | Coding needed |
| GTI/GLI/R Steering Wheel Controls | Feasible | Coding & ACC Adaptation needed |


   _OEM HW (original equipment manufacturer hardware) feasibility - determines if the original hardware (parts, control units, connectors) can be used. Coding Feasibility - determines if the existing control unit supports that project._
