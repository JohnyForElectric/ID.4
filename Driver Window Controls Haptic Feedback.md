# Driver Window Controls Haptic Feedback 
## Situation:
There are only two driver side window controls that by default control front driver and passenger windows. 
- To control the rear windows the "REAR" soft button needs to be touched for more than 1 second, then the button lights up and the rear windows can be controlled by the same controls that previously controlled the front windows. The button stays lit for 10 seconds, then turns off, reverting the controls to the front windows. 
- If the "REAR" soft button is touched and hold for 2+ seconds, it starts to blink and all four windows can be controlled at the same time. 

## Issues:
1. There is no sensual "dot or mark" where the button is, so it can't be located without looking
2. There is no haptic feedback in case the button is touched or pressed and held to change modes
3. There is a small "chime" in the speakers once the mode is changed, but it's not too obvious and can be missed. 
4. Further more the button is touched over the same area that lights up to indicate the mode, and itâ€™s not possible to easily visually see the mode it entered, unless the finger is lifted.
