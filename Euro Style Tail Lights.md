## Situation
There are two types of taillights on the ID.4. The "base" style and the smart "ID.Light" that are only available in Europe in higer trim vehicles. The US taillights used  for model years 2021 and 2022 are simple modification of the base Euro. Those replace the yeallow LED in the unit for the taillight for red. In addition the US spec vehicle has the brake segment of the light physically internally connected to the "red" turn segment. The taillguths have 3 parts - left, right and middle portion. While all three parts have 


- To control the rear windows the "REAR" soft button needs to be touched for more than 1 second, then the button lights up and the rear windows can be controlled by the same controls that previously controlled the front windows. The button stays lit for approx. 10 seconds, then turns off, reverting the controls to the front windows. 
- If the "REAR" soft button is touched and held for 2+ seconds, it starts to blink and all four windows can be controlled at the same time :heart:. 

## Challenges
1. The REAR soft button can't be located easilly without looking. There is no "dot or mark" that you can feel with your finger to locate the button
2. There is no haptic feedback in case the button is activated indicating the mode selected REAR/ALL modes
     - There is a small "chime" in the speakers once the mode is changed, but it's not too obvious and can be easily missed (in addition it relies on a different sense in the body than the one initiating the action, so it is easy to miss) 
     - Furthermore while the button is touched by your finger, the finger covers the light that indicates the selected mode, and itâ€™s not possible to even see the mode it entered, unless the finger is lifted. That only means more distraction from driving.
